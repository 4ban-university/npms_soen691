Check out the [documentation for the current release](/docs/README.md)!\n- Want to help us test the latest and greatest? Check out the [documentation for the next release](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/tree/4.0)!\n\n## Sample `gulpfile.js`\n\nThis file will give you a taste of what gulp does.\n\n```js\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\nvar coffee = require('gulp-coffee');\nvar concat = require('gulp-concat');\nvar uglify = require('gulp-uglify');\nvar imagemin = require('gulp-imagemin');\nvar sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps');\nvar del = require('del');\n\nvar paths = {\n  scripts: ['client/js/**/*.coffee', '!client/external/**/*.coffee'],\n  images: 'client/img/**/*'\n};\n\n// Not all tasks need to use streams\n// A gulpfile is just another node program and you can use any package available on npm\ngulp.task('clean', function() {\n  // You can use multiple globbing patterns as you would with `gulp.src`\n  return del(['build']);\n});\n\ngulp.task('scripts', ['clean'], function() {\n  // Minify and copy all JavaScript (except vendor scripts)\n  // with sourcemaps all the way down\n  return gulp.src(paths.scripts)\n    .pipe(sourcemaps.init())\n      .pipe(coffee())\n      .pipe(uglify())\n      .pipe(concat('all.min.js'))\n    .pipe(sourcemaps.write())\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('build/js'));\n});\n\n// Copy all static images\ngulp.task('images', ['clean'], function() {\n  return gulp.src(paths.images)\n    // Pass in options to the task\n    .pipe(imagemin({optimizationLevel: 5}))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('build/img'));\n});\n\n// Rerun the task when a file changes\ngulp.task('watch', function() {\n  gulp.watch(paths.scripts, ['scripts']);\n  gulp.watch(paths.images, ['images']);\n});\n\n// The default task (called when you run `gulp` from cli)\ngulp.task('default', ['watch', 'scripts', 'images']);\n```\n\n## Incremental Builds\n\nWe recommend these plugins:\n\n- [gulp-changed](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-changed) - only pass through changed files\n- [gulp-cached](https://github.com/contra/gulp-cached) - in-memory file cache, not for operation on sets of files\n- [gulp-remember](https://github.com/ahaurw01/gulp-remember) - pairs nicely with gulp-cached\n- [gulp-newer](https://github.com/tschaub/gulp-newer) - pass through newer source files only, supports many:1 source:dest\n\n## Want to contribute?\n\nAnyone can help make this project better - check out our [Contributing
